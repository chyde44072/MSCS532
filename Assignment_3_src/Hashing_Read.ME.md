# Hash Table with Chaining

## Overview

This project implements a hash table using chaining for collision resolution. The implementation uses a universal hash function to minimize collisions and supports efficient `insert`, `search`, and `delete` operations.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements:**  
   - Python 3.x

2. **Usage:**  
   - Place the hash table implementation in a Python file (e.g., `hash_table_chaining.py`).
   - Import and use the `HashTableChaining` class in your scripts, or add a test harness to the file to run sample operations.
