# Randomized Quicksort Analysis

## Overview

This project implements and analyzes the Randomized Quicksort algorithm, comparing it empirically to Deterministic Quicksort (which always chooses the first element as the pivot). The code tests both algorithms on arrays of various sizes and distributions, including random, sorted, reverse-sorted, and repeated elements.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.13)
   - `numpy` library

2. **Install numpy (if needed):**
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```
   python Randomized_QuickSort_Analysis.py
   ```

   The script will print timing results for both algorithms on different array types and sizes.
