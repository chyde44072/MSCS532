Quicksort Performance Analysis

Overview
This module provides comprehensive performance testing and analysis of both deterministic and randomized Quicksort algorithms, comparing their behavior across different input sizes and data distributions.

Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Optional: matplotlib and numpy for visualization

How to Run
```bash
python performance_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Test both algorithms on various array sizes (100, 500, 1000, 2000 elements)
- Analyze performance across different data types (random, sorted, reverse, nearly sorted, duplicates)
- Display comprehensive performance metrics and comparisons
- Generate performance plots (if matplotlib is available)
- Show empirical validation of theoretical time complexities
