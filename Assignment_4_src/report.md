# Assignment 4: Heap Data Structures - Implementation and Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive implementation and analysis of heap data structures, focusing on their applications in sorting algorithms (Heapsort) and priority queue operations. The project demonstrates the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and empirical performance characteristics of these fundamental data structures.

## 1. Heapsort Implementation and Analysis

### 1.1 Algorithm Implementation

The heapsort implementation follows the standard algorithm structure:

1. **Build Max-Heap**: Convert the input array into a max-heap structure
2. **Extract Maximum**: Repeatedly extract the maximum element and place it at the end
3. **Maintain Heap Property**: Restore heap property after each extraction

#### Key Implementation Details:
- **Array-based representation**: Uses implicit binary tree structure
- **In-place sorting**: Requires only O(1) additional space
- **Recursive heapify**: Maintains heap property through recursive calls

### 1.2 Time Complexity Analysis

#### Theoretical Analysis:
- **Build Max-Heap**: O(n) - Counter-intuitive but provable through mathematical analysis
- **Extract Maximum**: O(log n) per operation, performed n times = O(n log n)
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n log n) for all cases

#### Why O(n log n) in All Cases:
1. **Best Case**: Even with sorted input, must build heap and extract elements
2. **Average Case**: Random input requires full heap operations
3. **Worst Case**: Reverse-sorted input doesn't change fundamental operations

The consistent O(n log n) performance across all input distributions makes heapsort unique among comparison-based sorting algorithms.

### 1.3 Space Complexity Analysis

- **Space Complexity**: O(1) auxiliary space
- **In-place Algorithm**: Sorts within the original array
- **No Additional Data Structures**: Unlike merge sort's O(n) space requirement

### 1.4 Empirical Performance Comparison

Testing conducted on various input sizes (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 elements) and distributions:

#### Input Distributions Tested:
1. **Random Data**: Uniformly distributed random integers
2. **Sorted Data**: Already sorted in ascending order
3. **Reverse-Sorted Data**: Sorted in descending order
4. **Data with Duplicates**: Limited range with many duplicate values

#### Performance Observations:
- **Heapsort**: Consistent performance across all input types
- **Quicksort**: Excellent average case but degrades on sorted inputs
- **Merge Sort**: Consistent performance but requires additional space

#### Key Findings:
1. Heapsort provides predictable performance regardless of input distribution
2. While often slower than quicksort in practice, it never degrades to O(n²)
3. The constant space requirement makes it suitable for memory-constrained environments

## 2. Priority Queue Implementation

### 2.1 Design Decisions

#### Data Structure Choice:
- **Array-based Binary Heap**: Chosen for efficient memory usage and cache performance
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Supports growing and shrinking of the heap
- **Position Tracking**: Maintains task ID to heap index mapping for O(1) lookups

#### Task Representation:
```python
@dataclass
class Task:
    task_id: int
    priority: int
    arrival_time: float
    deadline: float
    description: str = ""
```

#### Heap Type Selection:
- **Max-Heap**: Higher priority values processed first
- **Min-Heap**: Lower priority values processed first
- **Configurable**: Runtime selection based on scheduling requirements

### 2.2 Core Operations Analysis

#### Insert Operation - O(log n)
1. Add element to end of array
2. Bubble up to restore heap property
3. Update position tracking

#### Extract Maximum/Minimum - O(log n)
1. Store root element (to return)
2. Move last element to root
3. Bubble down to restore heap property
4. Update position tracking

#### Increase/Decrease Key - O(log n)
1. Locate element using position tracking
2. Modify priority value
3. Bubble up or down as needed

#### Is Empty - O(1)
- Simple array length check

### 2.3 Implementation Optimizations

1. **Position Tracking**: Enables O(1) task lookup by ID
2. **Efficient Swapping**: Updates position tracking during element swaps
3. **Type Safety**: Uses dataclasses and type hints for robustness
4. **Error Handling**: Validates operations (e.g., can't extract from empty heap)

## 3. Task Scheduling Applications

### 3.1 Scheduling Algorithms Implemented

#### Max-Heap Scheduling (Highest Priority First):
- Processes tasks with highest priority values first
- Suitable for systems where urgent tasks must be completed quickly
- May cause starvation of low-priority tasks

#### Min-Heap Scheduling (Lowest Priority First):
- Processes tasks with lowest priority values first
- Ensures all tasks eventually get processed
- May delay critical tasks

### 3.2 Performance Metrics

#### Scheduling Effectiveness Measures:
1. **Total Completion Time**: Time to complete all tasks
2. **Average Waiting Time**: Average time tasks spend in queue
3. **Missed Deadlines**: Number of tasks completed after deadline
4. **Throughput**: Tasks completed per unit time

### 3.3 Empirical Scheduling Results

Testing with realistic task scenarios revealed:

#### Max-Heap Scheduling:
- **Advantages**: Critical tasks completed quickly
- **Disadvantages**: Low-priority tasks may be delayed significantly
- **Best Use Case**: Real-time systems with strict deadlines

#### Min-Heap Scheduling:
- **Advantages**: More equitable task processing
- **Disadvantages**: Critical tasks may be delayed
- **Best Use Case**: Batch processing systems

### 3.4 Stress Testing Results

Performance testing with large task sets (up to 10,000 tasks):

- **Insertion Performance**: Scales as expected O(log n)
- **Extraction Performance**: Maintains O(log n) scaling
- **Memory Usage**: Linear growth with task count
- **Overall System Performance**: Suitable for production workloads
