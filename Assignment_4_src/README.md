## Key Components

### 1. Heapsort Implementation (`heapsort_analysis.py`)
- **Complete heapsort algorithm** with clear, efficient implementation
- **Performance analysis** comparing heapsort with quicksort and merge sort
- **Time complexity analysis** for best, average, and worst cases
- **Empirical testing** on different input distributions (sorted, reverse-sorted, random)
- **Heap construction visualization** to demonstrate the algorithm steps

### 2. Priority Queue Implementation (`priority_queue_implementation.py`)
- **Binary heap-based priority queue** using array representation
- **Task class** with priority, arrival time, deadline, and metadata
- **Support for both max-heap and min-heap** operations
- **Core operations** with time complexity analysis:
  - `insert(task)`: O(log n)
  - `extract_max/min()`: O(log n)
  - `increase/decrease_key()`: O(log n)
  - `is_empty()`: O(1)

### 3. Task Scheduler Simulation (`task_scheduler_simulation.py`)
- **Real-world task scheduling** system using priority queue
- **Performance comparison** between max-heap and min-heap scheduling
- **Stress testing** with large numbers of tasks
- **Scheduling metrics** including waiting time and missed deadlines

## Design Decisions

### Data Structure Choice
- **Array-based heap representation** for efficient memory usage and cache performance
- **Position tracking** for O(1) task lookup by ID
- **Configurable heap type** (max-heap or min-heap) for different scheduling strategies

### Task Representation
- **Task class** with comprehensive metadata (ID, priority, arrival time, deadline)
- **Comparison operators** for seamless integration with heap operations
- **Flexible priority system** supporting both high-priority-first and low-priority-first scheduling

## Performance Analysis

### Heapsort Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for all cases (best, average, worst)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - in-place sorting
- **Stability**: Not stable (relative order of equal elements may change)

### Priority Queue Operations
- **Insertion**: O(log n) - Element bubbles up to correct position
- **Extraction**: O(log n) - Root removal followed by heapify-down
- **Priority Modification**: O(log n) - Requires position adjustment
- **Peek**: O(1) - Direct access to root element

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required

### Running the Code

1. **Heapsort Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python heapsort_analysis.py
   ```
   - Runs heapsort on various test cases
   - Compares performance with quicksort and merge sort
   - Displays time complexity analysis

2. **Priority Queue Demonstration**:
   ```bash
   python priority_queue_implementation.py
   ```
   - Demonstrates max-heap and min-heap operations
   - Shows priority modification functionality
   - Includes performance benchmarking

3. **Task Scheduler Simulation**:
   ```bash
   python task_scheduler_simulation.py
   ```
   - Simulates realistic task scheduling scenarios
   - Compares different scheduling strategies
   - Performs stress testing with large task sets

## Key Findings

### Heapsort Analysis
- **Consistent Performance**: Unlike quicksort, heapsort maintains O(n log n) performance regardless of input distribution
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses constant extra space, making it suitable for memory-constrained environments
- **Practical Performance**: Often slower than quicksort in practice but more predictable

### Priority Queue Applications
- **Task Scheduling**: Effective for managing tasks with different priorities and deadlines
- **Resource Management**: Optimal for systems requiring fair resource allocation
- **Real-time Systems**: Suitable for applications requiring predictable response times

### Scheduling Strategy Comparison
- **Max-heap scheduling**: Better for systems prioritizing urgent tasks
- **Min-heap scheduling**: Useful for ensuring all tasks get processed
- **Performance trade-offs**: Higher priority tasks may cause lower priority tasks to starve

## Theoretical vs. Empirical Results

The empirical testing confirms the theoretical analysis:
- Heapsort consistently performs at O(n log n) across all input types
- Priority queue operations scale logarithmically with queue size
- Task scheduling performance depends on task distribution and priority strategy

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates the practical utility of heap data structures in both sorting and priority queue applications. The consistent performance characteristics of heapsort and the efficiency of heap-based priority queues make them valuable tools for system-level programming and real-time applications.

The project successfully implements all required components with comprehensive analysis and testing, providing insights into the trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches and their real-world applications.

## Future Enhancements

- **Fibonacci Heap**: Implementation for improved decrease-key operations
- **Parallel Heapsort**: Multi-threaded version for better performance on large datasets
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Integration with more sophisticated scheduling algorithms
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of heap operations and scheduling progress
