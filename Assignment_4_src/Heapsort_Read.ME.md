# Heapsort Implementation and Analysis

## Overview
This module implements the Heapsort algorithm using Python, providing a clear, efficient implementation that follows the correct steps for building a max-heap, extracting the maximum element, and maintaining the heap property.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required

## How to Run
```bash
python heapsort_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Run heapsort on various test cases
- Compare performance with quicksort and merge sort
- Display time complexity analysis
- Show heap construction demonstration
