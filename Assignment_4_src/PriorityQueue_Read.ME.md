# Priority Queue Implementation

## Overview
This module implements a binary heap-based priority queue for task scheduling applications. The implementation supports both max-heap and min-heap operations with a focus on efficient task management.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required

## How to Run
```bash
python priority_queue_implementation.py
```

This will:
- Demonstrate max-heap and min-heap operations
- Show priority modification functionality
- Include performance benchmarking

### Task Scheduler Simulation
```bash
python task_scheduler_simulation.py
```

This will:
- Simulate realistic task scheduling scenarios
- Compare different scheduling strategies
- Perform stress testing with large task sets
